# FPGA
In this repository, I will share miscellaneous FPGA projects I am working on (or have completed).

My first FPGA project is an 8-bit CPU build in VHDL based on Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU. See https://www.rehsdonline.com/post/vhdl-8-bit-cpu-ben-eater-edition-working.

Arty VGA MicroBlaze: See https://www.rehsdonline.com/post/arty-vga-walkthrough.
