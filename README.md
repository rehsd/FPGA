# FPGA
In this repository, I will share miscellaneous FPGA projects I am working on (or have completed). I am a hobbyist, and I provide no guarantee that what is shared here works, is defect free, etc. I post here in case others find it helpful.

My first FPGA project is an 8-bit CPU built in VHDL based on Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU. See https://www.rehsdonline.com/post/vhdl-8-bit-cpu-ben-eater-edition-working.

Arty VGA MicroBlaze: See https://www.rehsdonline.com/post/arty-vga-walkthrough.

More recently (2024), I am working on some Lattice iCE40 projects. See https://www.rehsdonline.com/post/lattice-ice40-fpga-journey.
